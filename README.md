# API Project With MongoDb
I made CRUD operations in a sample API project. In this project, I worked with the NoSql database "Mongo DB". The only difference between MsSql and Api construction is the tools and classes used. The operation is generally the same. The format coming from the database in the API project is JSON type. Since MongoDB is a NoSQL database, it stores its data as JSON-like documents. This gives us flexibility and convenience. Faster queries can be made. Considering these advantages, tables that do not have a relational function can be created in Mongo db. However, it may not be correct to keep the database with strong inter-table relations in a NoSql database.

MongoDB is a very popular NoSQL type application known by IT professionals all over the world. Built entirely on a modern basis, MongoDB is a very effective system part that has been used for cloud databases.

MongoDB is a completely open source database management system tool that has nothing to do with noSQL. This system stores and manages all important data in the database on a disk. In this system, which is made available to store data, a BSON source similar to JSON is used.


## MongoDB Usage Benefits 

- It provides a much easier installation feature than other equivalents.
- It has a database system that does not need a schema at all. The tables we use in SQL are replaced by documents here.
- It is a very useful and high performance tool in terms of usage.
- Considering the costs in the IT sector in general, it is the whole of the database management system, which has a very affordable cost compared to other tools.

## Disadvantages

- Although MongoDB is faster than databases such as MySQL, Oracle and SQL Server in terms of performance, it should not be used in applications where data is important or be careful when using it because it has no rules and standards.

- Preparing complex queries with MongoDB can be more difficult than with SQL.
### Naming between MongoDB and SQL

# API (Application Programming Interface)

API key is used to monitor how application programming interfaces are used and to reduce misuse. The API key is the code structure that consists of user data and is transmitted during the interface call. It is the interface that enables the functions of an application to be accessed and used externally or remotely. API is a software tool that allows two applications to communicate with each other. API allows any server to return a response and access the application on the server from different platforms. It does not matter in which language the program used is written. Because the data captured using the Api is converted into a common JSON document.

If we give an example of API usage;

ATMs learn the remaining amount in our account through APIs connected to banks all over the world. The ATM program that withdraws money from Istanbul immediately contacts your bank in London, deducts the amount to be withdrawn from your balance and transfers it to the ATM company. In this way, you will have access to your money.
