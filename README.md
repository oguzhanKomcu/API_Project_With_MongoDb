# API Project With MongoDb
I made CRUD operations in a sample API project. In this project, I worked with the NoSql database "Mongo DB". The only difference between MsSql and Api construction is the tools and classes used. The operation is generally the same. The format coming from the database in the API project is JSON type. Since MongoDB is a NoSQL database, it stores its data as JSON-like documents. This gives us flexibility and convenience. Faster queries can be made. Considering these advantages, tables that do not have a relational function can be created in Mongo db. However, it may not be correct to keep the database with strong inter-table relations in a NoSql database.

# MONGO DB

MongoDB is a very popular NoSQL type application known by IT professionals all over the world. Built entirely on a modern basis, MongoDB is a very effective system part that has been used for cloud databases.

MongoDB is a completely open source database management system tool that has nothing to do with noSQL. This system stores and manages all important data in the database on a disk. In this system, which is made available to store data, a BSON source similar to JSON is used.


## MongoDB Usage Benefits 

- It provides a much easier installation feature than other equivalents.
- It has a database system that does not need a schema at all. The tables we use in SQL are replaced by documents here.
- It is a very useful and high performance tool in terms of usage.
- Considering the costs in the IT sector in general, it is the whole of the database management system, which has a very affordable cost compared to other tools.
