# How I Made an API Project Using MongoDB ? 

## MongoDB Installation and Usage

- Since I want to keep my database locally, I downloaded the [Community Server](https://github.com/oguzhanKomcu/DATA_ACCESS/tree/master/DB_First). file from MongoDb's own site. Database operations can be done by subscribing to the cloud server, if desired.

- MongoDb can also be used directly with the CMD line if desired. However, if you want an interface like Sql, you need to download [ MongoDB Compass](https://github.com/oguzhanKomcu/DATA_ACCESS/tree/master/DB_First).

- After the installations are finished, I run MongoDB Compass directly.

- We first meet the "New Connection" page. Here we have the "ConnectionURI" address. Then I connect to MongoDB by saying "Conncect".

-I click on the "Databases" button on the Layout page. On the next page, I click on the "Create database" field and write my database name and the collection name. These fields and the names I will use in my Api project must be the same.

# Creating an API Project with Visual Studio 

- I am opening Visual Studio 2022. Here I am opening a "Blank Solution".

- Going to create a project in the solution, I create and open my project in the "Asp.Net Core Web API" type with a name I want.
